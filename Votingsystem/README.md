## Roles

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| User | Vote in running elections, review submitted votes, manage profile |
| Admin | Create and manage elections, view live results, see participants |
| Developer | Approve admin requests, manage all users and roles, system-wide stats |

## Poll Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Election | Single candidate selection — produces a ranked leaderboard with winner |
| Rating | 1–5 star scale — shows average score and distribution |
| Text | Free-text response — displays all submissions |
| Multi-choice | Select multiple options — shows % of voters per option |
| Ranking | Drag-to-rank — scored using Borda count |

## Custom Data Structure — VoteTally

`VoteTally` is a custom data structure designed to efficiently count and process votes in a single pass.

**Internal structure:**
- Parallel arrays `_ids[]`, `_labels[]`, `_scores[]` — one slot per candidate/option
- `_slotIndex` — `IntHashMap` (custom open-addressing hash map) mapping entity ID → array index for O(1) average lookup per vote

**Factory methods:**

```csharp
VoteTally.ForCandidates(candidates)   // election type
VoteTally.ForOptions(options)         // multichoice / ranking
VoteTally.ForRatingScale()            // rating type (slots 1–5)
```

**Recording votes:**

```csharp
tally.RecordSingleVote(candidateId)   // O(1)
tally.RecordRating(ratingValue)       // O(1)
tally.RecordMultiChoice(csv)          // O(selections) — parses CSV once
tally.RecordBordaRanking(csv)         // O(options) — awards Borda points in one pass
```

**Reading results:**

```csharp
tally.GetRankedResults()              // O(k log k) — sorted TallyEntry[]
tally.WeightedAverage()              // rating average from same tally
```

**Algorithmic improvement over the previous LINQ approach:**

| Poll type | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Election | O(votes × candidates) | O(votes) |
| Rating | O(votes × 5) + separate average | O(votes) |
| Multi-choice | O(votes × options) + CSV split per option | O(votes × avg selections) |
| Ranking | O(votes × options²) nested loop | O(votes × options) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarjanHD72/PersianBits-VotingSystem.git
cd PersianBits-VotingSystem/Votingsystem.frontend
dotnet run
```

Open `https://localhost:5001` in your browser. The database is created and seeded automatically on first run.

### Run unit tests

```bash
cd PersianBits-VotingSystem/VotingSystem.Tests
dotnet test
```

### Change the database file path

Edit `Votingsystem.frontend/appsettings.json`:

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "Data Source=/path/to/your/database.db"
}
```

### Demo accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|---|---|---|
| Admin | admin@persianbits.com | admin123 |
| Developer | dev@persianbits.com | dev123 |
| Users (×100) | (random) | demo123 |

## Key Features

- **Session ID voting** — admins share a short code (e.g. `PRES-2025`); users enter it to join
- **Vote review** — users can revisit any poll they voted in and see their answer read-only
- **Live avatar** — changing your profile avatar reflects in the header instantly without re-login
- **Candidate photos** — election polls support candidate photos in the vote form and results page
- **Real-time results** — results page updates on every load with winner highlighted and photo
- **Participant-scoped users** — admins only see users who voted in their own elections
- **Dark / light theme** — toggle in the header
- **AI assistant** — in-app chat powered by a local Ollama model (requires Ollama on port 11434)

## Seeded Demo Data

On first run the seeder:
1. Fetches 100 user profiles from randomuser.me (falls back to built-in names if offline)
2. Downloads 7 candidate portrait photos into `wwwroot/uploads/`
3. Creates 7 elections (4 running, 2 closed, 1 draft) all owned by the default admin
4. Records votes for all 100 users with weighted distributions so elections have a clear winner

---

## Email Configuration

For admin-request notification emails, configure `appsettings.json`:

```json
"Email": {
  "SmtpHost": "smtp.gmail.com",
  "SmtpPort": "587",
  "SmtpUser": "",
  "SmtpPass": "",
  "FromEmail": "",
  "AdminEmail": ""
}
```

Leave empty to disable — the app works fully without it.
